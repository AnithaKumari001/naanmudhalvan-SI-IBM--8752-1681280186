Description:- 

House price prediction is a common problem in the real estate industry and
involves predicting the selling price of a house based on various features and attributes. The
problem is typically approached as a regression problem, where the target variable is the
price of the house, and the features are various attributes of the house
The features used in house price prediction can include both quantitative and categorical
variables, such as the number of bedrooms, house area, bedrooms, furnished, nearness to
main road, and various amenities such as a garage and other factors that may influence the
value of the property.
Accurate predictions can help agents and appraisers price homes correctly, while
homeowners can use the predictions to set a reasonable asking price for their properties.
Accurate house price prediction can also be useful for buyers who are looking to make
informed decisions about purchasing a property and obtaining a fair price for their
investment.
